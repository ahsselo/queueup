# QueueUp - Collaborative Music Web Application
Queueup is a full-stack web application that allows multiple users to collaboratively 
queue songs in real time from separate devices. The system was developed as part of a 
team-based Software Engineering course using Agile and Scrum methodologies. 

**Overview**
QueueUp enables users to join a shared music session, add songs to a queue, filter by
genre, and synchronize playback across devices. The application was designed to 
simulate real-world collaborative environments such as parties, events, or shared
listening spaces. 

**Features**
- Real-time collaborative music queue
- Multi-device session access via QR code
- Genre-based song filtering
- Synchronized queue updates across users
- RESTful backend architecture
- Unit and integration testing
